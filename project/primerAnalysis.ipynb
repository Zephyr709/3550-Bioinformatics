    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we aim to evaluate and compare the performance of several primer design tools based on specific metrics that highlight the quality of primers, particularly in terms of specificity. The primary objective is not to optimize primer design, but to assess and compare the outputs generated by different tools, focusing on metrics like specificity scores, alignment quality, off-target hits, and 3' end mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is based on BLAST alignment results for primers designed by different tools. The analysis involves computing specificity scores, which are a combination of several factors including perfect matches, off-target hits, and mismatches at the 3' end of the primer sequence. We also visualize the results to provide an easy-to-understand comparison between the primer design tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "By conducting this primer design tool comparison experiment, we aim to identify which tool generates the highest-quality primers in terms of specificity, which is crucial for reliable PCR amplification. This approach allows researchers to make informed decisions about which tool to use based on the specific needs of their experiments, while providing valuable insights into the performance of popular primer design software.\n",

    "The `analyzeBlastResults` function is central to the analysis. It takes in BLAST result records, the primer length, and optional thresholds for the e-value and identity percentage. The function processes each BLAST alignment and computes various metrics related to primer specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Parameters:\n",
    "- **`blastRecords`**: The parsed BLAST result records for each primer.\n",
    "- **`primer_length`**: The length of the primer sequence.\n",
    "- **`e_value_threshold`**: The maximum acceptable e-value for an alignment to be considered significant (default: 0.01).\n",
    "- **`identity_threshold`**: The minimum identity percentage for an alignment to be considered a valid match (default: 0.8).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Code Sections:\n",
    "- **Parsing Alignments**: The function loops through each alignment in the BLAST results, checking for perfect matches, off-target hits, and 3' end mismatches.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for record in blastRecords:\n",
    "    for alignment in record.alignments:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        for hsp in alignment.hsps:\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop examines each High Scoring Pair (HSP) within an alignment to determine if it meets the criteria for perfect matches, off-target hits, or 3' end mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specificity Score Calculation**: The specificity score is computed using the following formula:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "specificity_score = (perfect_matches / total_hits) * (1 - (off_target_hits / total_hits)) * (1 - (three_prime_mismatches / total_hits)) * (1 - multiple_match_penalty)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This score is based on the proportions of perfect matches, off-target hits, 3' end mismatches, and a penalty for multiple perfect matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging Results**: The function prints key results for each primer:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(f\"Specificity Score: {specificity_score:.4f}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Total Hits: {total_hits}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Perfect Matches: {perfect_matches}\")\n",
